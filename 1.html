        <h3>Dr. No</h3>

        <p>Someone once said that the best Raymond Chandler novel is the first one you read, because between the debut of Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep (1939) and his last significant appearance in The Long Good-bye (1953), the books are pretty even in quality and there's nothing quite like the initial impact of Chandler's style, Marlowe's company and their colourful southern California locale. The same is not true of his devoted follower, Ian Fleming, whose first half-dozen James Bond novels are far superior to those that followed â€“ being more realistic, better plotted and altogether less fantastical. Casino Royale is arguably his best book, and when eventually it was filmed with Daniel Craig in 2006 (there had been a sad, jokey, non-canonical version in 1967), it was unquestionably the closest the movie series has come to capturing the spirit of Fleming's early work.</p>
