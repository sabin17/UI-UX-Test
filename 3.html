        <h3>Goldfinger</h3>

        <p>The first time I laid eyes on James Bond, he had just emerged from the ocean with a fake seagull on his head. He then blew up a drug lord's laboratory, peeled off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculate white DJ, snogged an exotic dancer, clocked in her eyeballs the reflection of a bad guy sneaking up behind them, tipped said bad guy into the bathtub, threw an electric heater in after him, and quipped: "Shocking, positively shocking!" All this, and the credits hadn't even started. My 12-year-old self thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Many years later, Goldfinger (1964) remains not just my favourite Bond movie, but the standard by which all other Bond movies must be judged. It has Sean Connery, of course, and the best theme song, incorporating Shirley Bassey and lashings of John Barry brass.And it has the best villain; Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) is a petty-minded plutocrat who cheats at cards and golf, and has the best ever evil dialogue. His masterplan is to profit from the economic chaos that will ensue after he has detonated an atomic bomb in Fort Knox, making America's gold reserves radioactive for 58 years. "He's quite mad, you know," Bond says to Pussy Galore, just in case any of us might have thought this was a viable get-rich-quick scheme. Ah yes: "Poosy", as Connery calls her – the implicitly (explicitly in Ian Fleming's novel) lesbian pilot with the ultimate absurd Bond girl name. And yet Honor Blackman, who plays her, never looks less than Totally In Control, even when required for plot purposes to yield to Bond's manliness. Mindful of Blackman's ass-kicking role as Cathy Gale in TV series The Avengers, the film-makers allow her to fell Bond with a judo throw, but that's as far as they go with this feminist nonsense. Bond promptly upends her in the hay, and overcomes that implicit lesbianism with just one kiss.</p>
