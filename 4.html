        <h3>Thunderball</h3>
        <p>By Nicholas Lezard| Oct 31, 2008</p> 
        <p>Rating : 3/5</p> 
        <p>There's an amusing skit in this week's Private Eye in which the magazine celebrates "100 Years of Bond" (sic). "Which is the best Bond girl ever?" it asks. Is it Mixi Mitosis, who played Yummy Puss in GoldenWonder (1969)? Tuesday Polanski who played Randy Lovechest in Die and Don't Live (1988)? Or Olga Smirnoff, "who plays Anna Legova in the latest Bond outing, You'll Only See This Once (2008)"?

            You get the idea. But in one quarter-page, it packs in more laughs than Bond's famous one-liners ever managed (which it would appear have been jettisoned for Quantum of Solace). So when I was asked by my editor to name my favourite Bond film, I found myself in something of a quandary. The Bond films do not pretend to be art – that is their chief virtue. They are a guilty pleasure, best enjoyed in the traditional manner: after Christmas lunch, stuffed and half-pissed, on ITV, with commercial breaks so you can make cups of tea and go to the lavatory. About three-quarters of the way through you are meant to fall asleep, only to be roused by the explosions destroying the enemy's secret base at the end.
            
            Casino Royale broke these rules: and it certainly looks good - "gritty", as they say all the time these days - even if Daniel Craig's tie-knot looks a little chavvy. But "realistic"? Give us a break. A spy is meant to be inconspicuous, so why does he get to drive an Aston Martin, a far flashier car these days (particularly as it is weighted with associations to ... er, James Bond) than it was in Sean Connery's day? And while we're at it, how does he get to afford one on what would essentially be a civil servant's salary? And having a defibrillator in the glove compartment – well, that came in handy, didn't it? Amazing how he's managed without one of those before.
            
            Quantum of Solace, which I am off to see with my boys later today, I cannot comment on. But it is nice of the producers to have used an Ian Fleming title – even though the original story, of which I doubt even a quantum amount has survived to the screen, is one in which no spying at all takes place. It's a rather poignant story-within-a story, one which describes the ghastly breakdown of a marriage.
            
            So when I try to think of my favourite Bond movie, I think back to the first four films, each of which had at least some connection to the original novels (which are, incidentally, enormous fun). And the look of them was great: the gaudy technicolor, Connery's suits, his skinny ties ... okay, it's going to be Thunderball. On the grounds that it teaches you how to steal a nuclear bomb. That kind of knowledge never goes out of date.</p>
