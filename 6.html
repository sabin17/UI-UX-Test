        <h3>On her Majesty's Secret Service</h3>
        <p>By Stuart Heritage| Feb 23, 2014</p>

        <p>On Her Majesty's Secret Service (OHMSS) had a lot to live up to. As far as the entire world was concerned, Sean Connery was James Bond. And here was some impostor – worse, an impostor from the colonies, George Lazenby, whom nobody had heard of – waltzing in to take his place. It wasn't right. It wouldn't do. To rub everyone's noses in it even further, On Her Majesty's Secret Service deliberately stuck closely to the book, which meant no audience-pleasing whizz-bang gadgets. And what's with the bummer of an ending? No wonder the film only took half the amount of You Only Live Twice at the box office.

            And yet I will fight anyone who dares to tell me that they don't like On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Because they are flat out wrong. In the 45 years since it was released, it stands out as one of the best 007 films ever. Possibly even the best. It has the best soundtrack. It pushes the character into difficult new places. And that ending: that's not just a great James Bond ending, it's probably in the top 10 film endings of all time. If you've never seen On Her Majesty's Secret Service, you should watch it. If you've seen On Her Majesty's Secret Service before, you should watch it again. And if you don't like it, I'm serious about fighting you.</p>
